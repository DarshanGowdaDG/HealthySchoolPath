# Healthy-School-Path
The Healthy School Path project is an interactive platform designed to teach students about health, wellness, and nutrition. It uses personalized tracking, real-time feedback, and engaging tools to promote lifelong healthy habits. Here's a deeper look into the frameworks and libraries used:

**Streamlit:** This is the main framework used for building the interactive web application. It allows for easy creation of web apps for data science and machine learning projects.
**Authentication:** Custom authentication mechanisms are implemented through modules like check_authentication, show_login, and show_registration.
**Component Modules:** Various health-related sections are modularized:
show_physical_section
show_learning_section
show_nutrition_section
show_mental_section
load_particles_js (possibly for visual effects)
**Database Initialization:** init_db is used to initialize the database, ensuring persistent data storage.
**Utility Functions:** Functions like calculate_streak and send_notification provide additional functionalities to enhance user experience.
Overall, the project integrates several custom modules and utilizes Streamlit to create an engaging and comprehensive health education platform.
